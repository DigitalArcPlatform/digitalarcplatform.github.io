# Digital Archiving & Storytelling for Historically Underrepresented-Communities

Our goal is to support the site-specific preservation needs of historically-underrepresented communities and their socio-cultural identity and narratives through digital archiving and digital storytelling. More than [platforms](https://github.com/idahatiu/idahatiu.github.io) and processes, we take a *holistic approach to community-archiving with a focus on people*. [Visit the FAQ](faq.md) for more information.

## Background

The ImaginX en Movimiento (IXeM) Collective and the Indiana University Bloomington Institute for Digital Arts & Humanities (IDAH) are each committed to providing a platform for historically excluded communities to document their often unheard or unseen histories as a way to share their stories and experiences as they navigate their lives amid predominantly white, male, heterosexual, Christian, English-speaking community structures.  

IXeM (ImaginX en Movimiento), is a grassroots digital archives collective based in Tongva territory (currently known as Los Angeles) that seeks to support archival projects being imagined and built outside of cultural heritage institutions by Black, Indigenous, women and LGBTQIA+ of color, and diasporic groups through solidarity and coalition-building. IXeM uses minimal computing solutions (cloud storage, social media, photo scanning applications) to build new digital infrastructure for supporting personal archives projects and to co-develop multimedia public history projects in partnership with museums, libraries, and organizations that rebuild connection, collective power, and deepens our sense of responsibility to one another. As an anti-colonial archives collective, IXeM is informed by the understanding that we all have different roles and obligations in the struggle to generate and regenerate transformative possibilities and futures for colonized and marginalized subjects, especially those at the intersections of historical and persistent marginality. 

IDAH, in partnership with the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society (CRRES), have been exploring community-driven archiving as a way to spotlight both long-standing and newly diasporic communities in Indiana and neighboring Midwest states. Indiana in particular is a state that has been historically white, majority Christian and politically conservative. Saturation and high-cost of living in states and cities with large diasporic and minority communities (i.e., Miami, FL) are forcing historically excluded communities to relocate and are often devoid of their socio-cultural markers. For instance, Columbus, Indiana, only 40 minutes from Indiana University, is home to a growing community of Latinx immigrants, but this community’s cultural imprint is not yet visible. Like Columbus, many other Indiana regions have seen growth in communities of historically excluded people, yet Monroe County, which is home to “progressive” residents of Bloomington and affiliates of Indiana University, has not seen such growth. We want to change this.  

Following on a pilot History Harvest, [Identity through Objects](https://historyharvest.indiana.edu/Fall2019/), that explored IUB’s global connections, we aim to draw on community archiving practices to shift the focus to historically excluded communities residing in and around Bloomington. By documenting individual stories and exploring the larger cultural patterns those individual stories convey, we hope to offer these communities a platform to communicate how they maintain or adapt their socio-cultural traditions as they navigate the dominant socio-cultural structures as part of their everyday lives. We also hope that this public-engagement platform will allow historically excluded communities to surface customs and traditions that are otherwise suppressed or significantly altered so that our community members are better positioned to take collective agency to advocate for and preserve their socio-cultural identities.       

The IXeM Collective provides a critical lens for academic-led or academic-partnered interests in community archiving as well as implementable guidelines to foster liberation-archiving without external interventions. Incorporating IXeM with an existing IDAH-CRRES collaboration will extend our ability to challenge policies and attitudes toward archiving adopted in academic and cultural heritage environments. The contexts for the IXeM Digital Archive and IDAH-CRRES History Harvest will likely differ, and the artifacts that comprise the digital archive will follow suit. At the same time, we can leverage our existing minimal computing options and attainable toolkits to support fully community-hosted and -published archiving. In partnership with IXeM, IDAH-CRRES will be able to extend the History Harvest model to capture more  complete stories that are led by the community and designed for the community.
